# myVector
## About

The built-in C++ Vector class from the standard library is based on a dynamically-allocated array. This project is a new implementation of the vector class, using a different design approach.

The Movie Reviews program uses .txt files that consist of movie reviews as a way of testing and utilizing the new vector class(myVector).

## How it works
You can run the program using the .txt files within the directory or create new ones with the following format:
* line 1 : Movie name
* ... rest of the lines : ratings 1-5

## How to run program in shell
From the project directory execute:
```$>./a.out movie1.txt```
